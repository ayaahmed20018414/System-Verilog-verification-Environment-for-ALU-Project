# System-Verilog-verification-Environment-for-ALU-Project

Introduction 
In this project, I implemented ALU (arithmetic logic unit) using SV and tested that it works well using SV verification Environment. SV environment consists of: (Test Class, Environment class, Scoreboard class, Monitor, Driver Class, Transaction class and generator class). I also used interface block between DUT and my test class module in testbench top module as shown in figure[1]
